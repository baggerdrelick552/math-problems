// This is just an example of how you can create a PHP script. Feel free to adapt it as needed.
// Here, we'll randomly choose some examples from your school's curriculum and use them for our project.

// Example 1: Simple math problem (e.g., 5 + 3)
$example1 = "5 + 3";
echo $example1; // Output: 8

// Example 2: Addition of two numbers
$example2 = "4 + 7";
echo $example2; // Output: 11

// More examples from your school's curriculum...
